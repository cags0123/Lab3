            <p>It is important to use descriptive file names for image files because it helps stay organized and makes it easier to identify your files.</p>

            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint to change the size of the image.</p>

            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image in pixels was 10566x7036.</p>

            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->

            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">

            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
